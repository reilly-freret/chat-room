### To Test Our Project: ###
-We have tested this extensively on our instance; we saw Professor Sproull post that this does not need to be running on the instance. As a result, we decided to not run in background. 
-Please download our repo and then run npm install. 
-This will make sure that you get the most current dependencies.  
-please then run “node chat-server.js”
-you then can access it on your port 3456

### Creative Portion: ###
-We created an amazing translation feature. This will allow you to  send message to your friends in different languages! We added Spanish, Russian, Polish, and French!
-For this, we had to learn a new api Google Translate. We ended up taking a good amount of time learning how to respond to the api call, and especially learning to use a api/framework on our Node Js server. This is something we had not done before in Node.js.
